MySQL is a Relational Database Management System, or RDBMS.
This means it stores data in tables and creates relationships between the data in the different tables.
Unlike spreadsheets, relational databases are able to manipulate millions of rows rapidly and effectively.
Relation databases are the most common way to permanently store data.
